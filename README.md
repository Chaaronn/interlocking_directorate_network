# Recursive Company Tree Analyzer

This Python project uses the [Companies House API](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/) to fetch and analyze the hierarchical structure of significant controllers (SIGs) for a given company. It retrieves detailed information about companies and their significant controllers recursively, creating a tree-like structure of ownership and control.
